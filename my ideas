# The problem this program aims to solve is how to create an engaging and interactive storytelling experience that allows readers to actively participate in shaping the direction of an adventure story- I have been working on ways to keep my ADHD child engaged in reading- these types of stories have provided an avenue for engagement and I would like to continue to help other parents facing similar issues. The input data will include user choices at key decision points within the story, such as selecting a character’s action, direction, or response to challenges. The program will use these inputs to navigate through a branching storyline, determining the next scene or outcome based on the user's selections. To solve the problem, the program will implement a decision-tree or flowchart structure that tracks user choices and progresses the narrative accordingly. The output will be a dynamic and personalized version of the story, with different paths and endings revealed based on the reader’s decisions, providing a unique and entertaining experience each time.The problem this program aims to solve is how to create an engaging and interactive storytelling experience that allows readers to actively participate in shaping the direction of an adventure story- I have been working on ways to keep my ADHD child engaged in reading- these types of stories have provided an avenue for engagement and I would like to continue to help other parents facing similar issues.
